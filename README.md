# Handy HoYo
An app to make your HoYo slave life a lot easier.

*It's a stripped-down version of HoYoLAB aimed to improve speed and functionality by discarding less-used features and adding third-party ones.
## Features
Tools and features for HoYoverse's games (i.e. Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Honkai Impact 3rd, Tears of Themis), such as:

1. Check-in
2. Redeeming code
3. User ID
4. Battle chronicle/records
5. In-game map
6. Wiki
7. Enhancement Calculator
8. Project Amber & Project Yatta
9. KQM
10. Enka.Network

*Some features are only available on certain games.

*Press and hold a certain button for 2-3s, something nice might happen (hehe).
## Download
Get it from [here](https://github.com/Sakadyk/Handy-HoYo/releases).
## Limitations
1. The inability to download certain things (i.e. Spiral Abyss result, enka.network card), it's recommended to use the share button and another browser to download it.
2. Won't be able to utilize some features from HoYoLAB due to in-app exclusivity.
3. The Enhancement Calculator for Genshin Impact can't synchronize with in-game characters.
4. Only available for Android 8.0+.
## Disclaimer
The developer of this app has no idea about publishing an app. It's just a passion mini-project.
