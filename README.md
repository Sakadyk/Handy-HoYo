# Handy HoYo
An app to make your HoYo slave life a lot easier.

*It's a stripped-down version of HoYoLAB aimed to improve speed by discarding less used features and adding third-party ones.

1. Check-in
2. Redeeming code
3. User ID
4. Battle chronicle/records
5. In-game map
6. Wiki
7. Enhancement Calculator
8. KQM

## Download
Get it from [here](https://github.com/Sakadyk/Handy-HoYo/releases).
## Limitations
1. The inability to download certain things (i.e. Spiral Abyss result, enka.network card), it's recommended to use the share button and another browser to download it.
2. Won't be able to utilize some features from HoYoLAB due to in-app exclusivity.
3. The Enhancement Calculator for Genshin Impact can't synchronize with in-game characters.
## Disclaimer
The developer of this app has no idea about publishing an app. It's just a passion mini-project.
